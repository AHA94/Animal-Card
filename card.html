			<p id="fact">camel is an even-toed ungulate in the 
				genus Camelus that bears distinctive fatty 
				deposits known as "humps" on its back.
				Camels have long been domesticated and,
				as livestock, they provide food (milk and meat) 
				and textiles (fiber and felt from hair).
				Camels are working animals 
				especially suited to their desert habitat 
				and are a vital means of transport for passengers and cargo.

			<p class="des">
				Camels are mammals with long legs, a big-lipped snout and a humped back. 
				There are two types of camels: dromedary camels, which have one hump, 
				and Bactrian camels, which have two humps. 
				Camels' humps consist of stored fat, which they can metabolize when food and water is scarce.

				In addition to their humps, camels have other ways to adapt to their environment. 
				They have a third, clear eyelid that protects their eyes from blowing sand. 
				Two rows of long lashes also protect their eyes. 
				Sand up the nose can be a problem, but not for camels. 
				They can shut their nostrils during sand storms.
